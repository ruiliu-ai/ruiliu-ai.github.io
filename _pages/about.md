* I am currently working as [TopMinds](https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html) at Huawei (base in HK) where I lead a research group of 30+ excellent researchers focusing on Multi-modal (Includes both vision understanding and generation) and AI Agent. 
* Before that, I was a senior researcher at SenseTime Group where I investigated on-device multi-modal models including vision language models (VLMs) and diffusion models (DMs). 
* I hold a PhD from [MMLab](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), CUHK, supervised by [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/) and [Prof. Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/).
