* I am currently pursuing a PhD in [Multimedia Lab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/) and Prof. [Hongsheng Li](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/). 
* I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2018. 
* My research interests include machine learning and computer vision, particularly in deep generative modelling and image/video synthesis. I also use it to facilitate low-level vision.
